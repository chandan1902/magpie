*' @description In this realisation biodiversity values are computed for each
*' land cover type. The calculations are based on the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII).
*' BII values for each land cover type are multiplied by the respective land area and
*' are weighted by cluster-specific range-rarity. This realisation also allows to introduce costs
*' on the loss of the total biodiversity value.
